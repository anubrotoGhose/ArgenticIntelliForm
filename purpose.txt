Use Case 1: 
Parsing Information from Structured Forms The system must extract data from structured forms, including PDFs, Word documents, and scanned copies, without requiring pre-training for each new form. 
The solution must support form processing for multi-lingual handwritten text and scanned documents with minor orientation shifts. 
The system must automatically map extracted fields to corresponding fields in the enterprise application without manual intervention. 
If an automatic mapping is not possible, the system must provide an interactive console for business admins to manually define mappings by selecting form fields and linking them to enterprise application fields. 
The solution must include a user-friendly, no-code interface for business admins to configure and fine-tune form parsing without requiring technical expertise. 
This is expected to a be UI based capability. 
In addition â€“ we are also looking at possibility to add custom logics using NLP e.g., if data received in form is a Data of Birth 01-Jan-1980, then should be able to auto-calculate the Age. 
The system must support real-time form processing with minimal latency and high accuracy. 
The solution must handle variations (same field appearing in section 1 vs section 2 in a different form) in form layouts dynamically without requiring explicit training for each new layout. 
Performance requirements are to be determined but the expectation is for identified forms the system should be able to extract information & populate to the application is less than 10 secs.
